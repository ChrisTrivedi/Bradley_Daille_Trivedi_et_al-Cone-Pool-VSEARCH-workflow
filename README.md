# VSEARCH_workflow
A shell script used to process raw Illumina amplicon data through VSEARCH and QIIME

This shell script can be used as such or by executing commands individually. Personally I like to go through each separately.

Please keep in mind this is more for my own consistency of data processing over different sample types. At this time I can offer no support on any issues.
